Now that we've looked at topological sort, it's time to deepen our understanding!

Implement Topological Sort using Kahn's algorithm, BFS and DFS. 

To receive extra credit, you must: 

Implement all three approaches, in Java OR Python
Have some sample input to demonstrate how the three approaches may topologically sort a graph
In the same folder, have a markdown/pdf/text file explaining the example. Brownie points if you actually draw a graph!
Submit only the link to your github repo with the extra credit folder.
